With art, we can distinguish the era it came from due to the characteristics it held. I'll be showing examples of art from certain eras, and what characteristics it holds.

![Madonna and Child, 14th Century, by Duccio](https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/438754/794829/main-image)
This is *Madonna and Child*, painted by Duccio di Buoninsegna, estimated 14th century. While it's painted near the start of the Renaissance era, it still holds the same characteristics as earlier __Medieval__ pieces. These characteristics include
    * Religious - most known Medieval pieces of today are tied in with Christianity in some way.
    * No Realism - the subjects in the painting are very 2D and flat

This is *Birth of Venus*, a very popular painting by Sandro Botticelli, in 1485. This piece represents the famous __Renaissance__ era. This is probably the most well known art era. The characteristics of the Renaissance era are
    * Realism - The subject is more 3D (especially compared to the Medieval era)
    * Perspective - Tying in with realism is perspective, and we can see in this painting that the background that's farther away, does in fact look farther away, as it's painted smaller.
    * Secular - While the renaissance does feature art that's religious, it's a lot more secular, and "human" based. It can be argued that the *Birth of Venus* is religious, as Venus is a Roman goddess. However, it's not *Christian* religous art, which is what most art was previously.

![The Battle of the Amazons, 1615, Peter Paul Rubens](https://img.theculturetrip.com/1440x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/peter_paul_rubens_-_the_battle_of_the_amazons_-_wga20272.jpg)
Here we have *The Battle of the Amazons* by Peter Paul Rubens, painted in 1615. This comes from the __Baroque__ era. While the Baroque era might be most known for it's music, the art is very recognizable.
    * Drama - This is the biggest factor of Baroque art. Just like Baroque classical music, it's meant to be dramatic. There's often a lot going on in paintings, and a lot of subjects, in order to fit this charateristic.
    * Lighting - Another way drama is represented in these paintings, is the lighting of the piece itself. Lots of pieces either feel dark, or have sharp shadows / big contrasts with the lighting.
    * Movement - Once again with drama, in order to create the look that there's a lot going on (like previously mentioned), the subjects are in the middle of movement, not all of them are just standing there or laying there.
    
![Boxer Rebellion, 1983, Jean Michel Basquiat](https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/jean-michel-basquiat/boxer-rebellion.jpg)
Since there's a lot of art eras, I wanted to jump straight into the __Contemporary__ era. The 1983, *Boxer Rebellion* by Jean Michel Basquiat, who's one of the most famous artists of the Contemporary Era. Contemporary art is a lot more difficult to break down into more than just one characteristic.
    * Challenges Traditions - Like how postmodern films challenge previous film eras, contemporary art also challenges past art traditions. There's no __one__ way to do Contemporary art correctly, especially because it's happening *now*. You're free to do what you want with it. It's there to provoke thought. Compare two contemporary artists like Ai Weiwei and Takashi Murakami. Murakami's famous 'Flowers', are a tribute to the atomic bombings of Japan in 1945, and represents repressed trauma. Meanwhile, Ai Weiwei's 'Sunflower Seeds' sculpture - thousands of handpainted porcelain pieces, meant to look like sunflower seeds, actually represents caring for others during hard times, since sunflower seeds are often shared, and the 'hard times' is in relation to Mao's regime where he's often depicted as the sun and everyone else as sunflowers.
