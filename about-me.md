Hello, as you can tell, my name is Jessica Mironyuk.

I'm currently a CSS major at UW Washington, and while I enjoy coding, I really enjoy art ! I think learning about art and art history is a great little hobby, since you don't have to worry about remembering everything like dates, artists, styles, like you would if you were taking a course in art history, or looking to earn a degree in it. I also find it enjoyable because there's so much information out there regarding art history, so you'll always have something to learn ! You can also  focus on artists of a certain era, or even *just* architecture throughout history if that's your thing too ! There's just so many possibilities : ) !! -->
