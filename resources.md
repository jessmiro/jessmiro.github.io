title: "Resources to learning about Art History"

There are a ton of resources out there for learning about art history, a few of my favorites include:

1. [Art History with Travis Lee Clark](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0yYUsx9vpuhu2dkk8_a9w)
    * Travis Lee Clark is a professor at Utah Valley University, and since his lectures are for his courses, you're learning the same information as his students, just *without* the stress of exams.
    
2. [EdX Free Art History Courses](https://www.edx.org/learn/art-history)
    * EdX provides some free "learn at your own pace" courses for art history, and while there isn't a big selection, it can still be useful !

3. [HielBrunn Timeline of Art History](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/)
    * The Met Museum has a timeline of the art in their collection, which includes essays and pictures of the art itself. -->
