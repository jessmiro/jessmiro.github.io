What better way to dive into art history than to visit an actual museum ! I've included some links to help you find museums.

[Find an Art Museum by State](https://www.museumsusa.org/museums/?k=1271410%2cCategoryID%3a200050%3bDirectoryID%3a200454)      
This is a great resource to find art museums in any state you're in, if you want to visit a museum other than an art one, you can broaden the search near the top. 

[Musee D'orsay Paris, Virtual](https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/musee-dorsay-paris?hl=en)  
If you want to visit a museum at the comfort of your home, or don't want to fly across the world to visit, Google offers a "virtual museum" for Musee D'orsay in Paris ! Just click on the art you're interested in, and a description will come up.
